## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Couldn't find package.json"

- âœ… Verify GitHub repo structure
- âœ… Clear build cache and redeploy

### "Dockerfile not found"
- âœ… Make sure Environment is "Node" not "Docker"
- âœ… Delete and recreate service if needed

### Build fails
- âœ… Check build logs in Render dashboard
- âœ… Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- âœ… Check Node.js version compatibility

### App loads but API calls fail
- âœ… Check CORS settings (CLIENT_URL in backend)
- âœ… Verify API URL in frontend environment variables
- âœ… Check if backend service is running
